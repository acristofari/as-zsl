# A decomposition method for lasso problems with zero-sum constraint

_Active-Set Zero-Sum-Lasso_ (AS-ZSL) is a solver for the following lasso problem with zero-sum constraint:

with given matrix A, vector y and non-negative scalar &lambda;.

AS-ZSL combines a tailored _active-set technique_, to identify the zero variables in the optimal solution,
with a _2-coordinate descent scheme_.

This software is written in C++ and can be called from Matlab using a MEX file.

## How to use AS-ZSL in Matlab

1. In Matlab, run `make.m` to build the MEX file.

2. See the file `usage.txt` to know how to call AS-ZSL from Matlab, change algorithm parameters and get output values.

3. See the file `main.m` for an example. To run the example, just call `main.m` in Matlab.
